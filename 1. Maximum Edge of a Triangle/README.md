# Maximum Edge of a Triangle

## Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element.


```js
nextEdge(8, 10) ➞ 17

nextEdge(5, 7) ➞ 11

nextEdge(9, 2) ➞ 10
```




# Notes
- ```(side1 + side2) - 1 ```js= maximum range of third edge.
- The side lengths of the triangle are positive integers.
- Don't forget to return  ``` return``` the result.
